## Heather Wright

Currently working in sales for a proptech company. Alongside this, I’m studying a course named ‘Get hired as a Software Developer’ with the Coder’s Guild. I’m hoping to get a junior role as a Frontend Developer once I complete the course. I’m passionate about tech and I hope to be part of the growing number of women finding success in a male-dominated industry.

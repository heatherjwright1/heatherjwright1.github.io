## Heather Wright

Currently working in sales for a proptech company. Alongside this, I’m studying a course named ‘Get hired as a Software Developer’ with the Coder’s Guild. I’m hoping to get a junior role as a Frontend Developer once I complete the course. I’m passionate about tech and I hope to be part of the growing number of women finding success in a male-dominated industry.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/heatherjwright1/heatherjwright1.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
